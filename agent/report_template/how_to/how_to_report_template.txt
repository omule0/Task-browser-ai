This report type focuses on extracting key technical implementation details.

The report structure should include:

1. Introduction (no research needed)
   - Brief overview of the technologies involved 
   - Brief overview of the problem or need 
   
2. Implementation Stages:
   Each stage should be a distinct section covering:
   - Problem Statement: What needed to be solved
   - Technical Approach: How it was implemented
   - Key Components: Tools, frameworks, or services used
   - Integration Points: How it connects to other parts
   Only include sections that cover unique aspects - do not force a specific number of sections.
   Aim for at most 3 sections to keep the report concise.

3. Conclusion (no research needed):
   - Key technical takeaways
   - Integration benefits
   - Future technical considerations

Each section should emphasize:
- Specific technical details
- Concrete implementation examples
- Measurable improvements
